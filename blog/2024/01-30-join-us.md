# Join the Ojos Project

The Ojos Project is looking for people interested in research to join! We are a research project under UC Irvine professor Mark S. Baldwin's Undergraduate Research Lab. Whether you're experienced with Linux or are a fantastic writer, we'd love to have you! Take a look to see how you can help!

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Purpose

Hospice patients are often immobile and slowly lose their independence, relying on the people around them to take care of them. It's difficult to help someone in this position when we often have other responsibilities, such as work.

During this moment, caregivers often have a lot on their mind. This can become dangerous if the caregiver forgets critical information about the patient's care, loses track of how often medication was taken, or forgets to report the patient's level of comfort.

The purpose of the Ojos Project is to increase patient independence by providing a kiosk-like assistant and to make sure all caregivers are on the same page by ensuring all information on the kiosk is up to date and synchronized with their personal devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è What are we doing?

We're researching the needs of hospice patients and caregivers to provide them with an easier way for caregivers to manage their loved one's care, while also allowing the patient as much independence as they would like.

Our current plan is to use tools such as the [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to build this system while experimenting with Linux Window Managers such as the [awesome window manager](https://awesomewm.org/). This may also include programming languages such as [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

All of our software will be for the good of those in need, and will be 100% free and open-source.

## üë∑ Member Responsibilities

The Ojos Project currently has two teams you can join: the URL team and the Research team. Responsibilities vary depending on which team you'd like to join. If you want to work on building the physical device, you may join the URL team that is physically on campus. However, if you prefer to be doing research, you may join the Research team to work on everything asynchronously. Regardless, you can view responsibilities on the [URL team homepage](https://docs.ojosproject.org/teams/url/) or the [Research team homepage](https://docs.ojosproject.org/teams/research/).

Individuals who are not enrolled in IN4MATX 199 may join and leave the project however they'd like. [Please read the Informatics 199 Acknowledement here](https://docs.ojosproject.org/teams/url/inf199-acknowledgement/).

## üôã How you can help

We're looking for individuals who already know, or are curious about, various technologies such as Linux, programming languages, or modifying existing software.

You can help if you want to do any of the following things:

- Requirements gathering
- Conducting interviews
- Documenting our work
- Researching topics about hospice

This is a learning experience for everyone, so if you don't know how to do some of the things in this least, please know we may just be in a similar boat! üõ∂

The benefits of joining the project include:

- Experience with...
  - Research
  - Raspberry Pi
  - Linux
  - ... and more!

## üìß Contact

If you'd like to join, or have any questions, please contact Carlos Valdez via [cvaldezh@uci.edu](mailto:cvaldezh@uci.edu) and he'll get back to you as soon as possible!
