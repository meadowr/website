## Overview

Interviewees will be asked various questions related to their experience as a caregiver and their emotional state during the experience. This interview would be conducted via a recorded [UCI Zoom](https://uci.zoom.us/) call (or a recorded in-person interview if the individual is in Irvine, CA). The information interviewees provide will be kept confidential, and if we do choose to publish our results, their identity will be anonymized. The data collected will be fully confidential otherwise and will be deleted upon our research's completion.

Healthcare professionals will be asked about their experiences with hospice patients and caregivers, as well as how technology could intervene to make the experience easier. We may also ask about emotional well-being for for patients, and how they've noticed software's involvement can help during this stressful time for caregivers.

## Requirements

- An individual who has been a caretaker for a family member in hospice
- A healthcare professional who
  - has experience working with hospice patients
  - has experience with emotional well-being

If you choose to participate in our research interview, you will be compensated with a $20 Starbucks gift card. Your contribution will help us understand hospice management to create a better experience for everyone involved.
