# Spring 2024 Wrap Up

![Ojos Project header](@site/static/images/header.png)

Happy pride! The 2024 Spring quarter is nearly at a close. That means we're
having an overview of the accomplishments we had for this quarter, as well as
outline our plans for the summer. We wrote about it more in
[this post](/news/surp-fellowship/).

## A look back

### Names

We came up with code names what we're building. [Iris](/docs/iris/) is the
hospice management system that can be installed on nearly any computer.
[Palliaview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l60y9Kog3sbdiTm0TlWQSpLGMTpvvO05bGnn72r-dA8/)
is our plug-and-play hardware solution that uses the Iris software.

### Our UROP Presentation

Ojos Project had a presentation at the 2024 Undergraduate Research Symposium
where we showed what we were working on to other researchers, students, and
faculty at the University of California, Irvine! We made another post about
this earlier, [which you can see here](/news/symposium-2024/).

### SURP Awards

The five members who signed up for UCI UROP's Summer Undergraduate Research
Program (SURP) won a SURP award! Congrats to Carlos, Joseph, Ayush, Meadow and
Kristopher!

### New Members

This quarter, we introduced five new members, and already they've contributed
very valuable insight into our project.

Meadow, Kristopher, Jesse, Jason and Mai -- thank you for joining our chaotic
group! ðŸ’ž

### Software Design

The Developers team began working on software design, which includes...

- [A C4 Model](/docs/iris/c4-model/)
- [A database schema](/docs/iris/database-schema/)
- [A filesystem overview](/docs/iris/filesystem/)
- [Flowcharts](/docs/iris/flowcharts/)

These methods are often used in industry before coding begins, and we decided
to follow this route to get a better idea of how we're going to build our
software.

### Coding Began

After months of research, planning, and software design, we _finally_ started
coding and exploring different solutions for our need.

Although we attempted to start by using [Python](https://www.python.org/), the
Developers voted to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) instead. Developers
are, as of now, attempting to learn Rust. Wish us luck!

<!-- ! Add Spring accomplishments by the Engineering team. -->

## A look forward

Spring 2024 was a _LOT_. There was a lot of planning, a lot of decisions that
were made, but we got through it. As always, there's still more to do. Here
are our (current) plans for Summer 2024:

- Developers
  - We plan to fully learn Rust and translate our current code into Rust
  - We're hoping we can get a beta version ready to go by the end of the summer
- Engineering
  - <!-- ! Add Summer goals for the Engineering team. -->
- Research
  - We're looking for a Research Lead; their responsibilities would include:
    - Organizing the project's research
    - Leading research efforts such as surveys and interviews
    - Assign Project members interviews and research notes
  - Conduct more interviews by our new members during the summer
