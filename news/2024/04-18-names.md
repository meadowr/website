# Announcing the name(s) of our work

![Ojos Project header](@site/static/images/header.png)

<!-- ! Make sure `slug`, `last_update`, and the filename are up to date. -->

After months of research, interviews, and requirements analysis, the Ojos
Project is finally ready to announce what we plan to name our work. As it turns
our, we're gonna have two names!

<!-- ? Do not remove the truncate line. -->

## Two names? Why?

<!-- We can both work on this. -->
<!-- Please add notes/comments on the pull request. -->
<!-- https://github.com/ojosproject/website/pull/7 -->

As we were working on requirements analysis, we realized there were two aspects
of the system we were creating: hardware and software. Our requirements analysis
document's software and hardware requirements quickly became intertwined and got
a bit confusing. So, we decided to split our work into two. We will release both
a software and a hardware component.

The software by itself will be freely installable on any Linux device, whereas
the hardware will include the software to provide a
[plug and play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug_and_play) experience.

As you've noticed, we've been calling this "the software" and "the hardware"
on this post, which is getting a little confusing, even as I'm writing. Let's
announce these names already!

## Announcing Iris, an open-source hospice assist

Iris, the Greek god who acted as a messenger between gods and humans.

It's fitting, as we're trying to develop a way to ensure all caregivers and
hospice nurses stay on the same page to ensure proper care of your loved one.
While the software- sorry. I mean, while Iris is [still in the early stages of
software design](/docs/iris/c4-model/),
we have high hopes that it will be beneficial to everybody involved.

<!-- todo: I don't think "hospice assist" is the best word choice. Should be changed. -->
<!-- todo: Should be expanded more. I think this is too short. -->

## Hardware

<!-- This is Joseph's section. -->

<!-- todo: Change the name of the section. -->
<!-- todo: Add content! âœ¨ -->
