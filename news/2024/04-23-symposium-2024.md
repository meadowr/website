On May 17, the Ojos Project gave a poster presentation at the 2024 UCI
Undergraduate Research Symposium! After months of work, we finally got to
present *everything*.

## What is the Undergraduate Research Symposium?

The UCI Undergraduate Research Symposium is an annual event where undergraduate
students have the opportunity to present their research to the UCI community. It
is a celebration of undergraduate research!

## Our Work

For the symposium, we were asked to create a poster that showcases the different
things we've been doing. Therefore,
[we created this poster](https://www.figma.com/design/a4hGzevpg0o86XjUwEVWvj/)
using Figma. We introduced our research, software design, and hardware.
