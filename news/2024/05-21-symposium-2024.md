# Ojos @ 2024 UCI Research Symposium

On May 17, the Ojos Project gave a poster presentation at the 2024 UCI
Undergraduate Research Symposium! After months of work, we finally got to
present *everything*.

<!-- truncate -->

## Background

For the last few months, the Ojos Project has been working on building two
things: a hospice management system, and a device that uses that system. On
February, [we announced that we got funding from UROP](/news/urop-and-finances/).
By receiving funding from UROP, we agreed to presenting at the Undergraduate
Research Symposium and show what we've been working on. Here it is!

### What is the Undergraduate Research Symposium?

The UCI Undergraduate Research Symposium is an annual event where undergraduate
students have the opportunity to present their research to the UCI community. It
is a celebration of undergraduate research!

Ultimately, is chance to present summation of all the work the Ojos team has done
this year to the public. It also allows our members to:

- Promote our research
- Gather Feedback on our topic and ideas that may be further implemented
- Interact with our peers and parents
- Network with Professionals

## The Event

This year we were able to have 5 of our members attend, but everyone on the team
was able to contribute to our success.

Heres how some of our members felt preparing and actually presenting for this
year's symposium.

> The UROP Symposium was a highly informative and educational experience! I
loved getting a glimpse into what my peers have been researching and working on
all year!

> Getting prepared for the symposium was nerve-wrenching but fun and informative
experience that expanded my previously non-existent experience in a professional
setting with deadlines.

> I enjoyed getting to experience a symposium for the the first time. I got to
practice my public speaking skills while sharing about a project that I enjoy
talking about.

### Our Poster

For the symposium, we were asked to create a poster that showcases the different
things we've been doing. Therefore,
[we created this poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-QbIBzGi8UYfNwEOQ8Uz16ER5uIzTz0T/view?usp=sharing)
using Figma software. We introduced our research, software design, and hardware.

## What's next?

The Symposium gave us a fantastic opportunity to show off ou work to other
individuals interested in research. However, it is now time for us to get back
to building. Keep a close eye on us for future announcements!
