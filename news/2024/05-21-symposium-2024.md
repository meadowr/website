# Ojos @ 2024 UCI Research Symposium

On May 17, the Ojos Project gave a poster presentation at the 2024 UCI
Undergraduate Research Symposium! After months of work, we finally got to
present *everything*.

<!-- truncate -->

## Background

For the last few months, the Ojos Project has been working on building two
things: a hospice management system, and a device that uses that system. On
February, [we announced that we got funding from UROP](/news/urop-and-finances/).
By receiving funding from UROP, we agreed to presenting at the Undergraduate
Research Symposium and show what we've been working on. Here it is!

### What is the Undergraduate Research Symposium?

The UCI Undergraduate Research Symposium is an annual event where undergraduate
students have the opportunity to present their research to the UCI community. It
is a celebration of undergraduate research!

## The Event

### Our Poster

For the symposium, we were asked to create a poster that showcases the different
things we've been doing. Therefore,
[we created this poster](https://www.figma.com/design/a4hGzevpg0o86XjUwEVWvj/)
using Figma. We introduced our research, software design, and hardware.

## What's next?

The Symposium gave us a fantastic opportunity to show off ou work to other
individuals interested in research. However, it is now time for us to get back
to building. Keep a close eye on us for future announcements!
