        <p>The Ojos Project is searching for individuals to participate in an interview regarding their experiences as caregivers for hospice patients. As researchers, our main responsibility is to collect data to build the right thing. If you're interested, please keep reading!</p>

        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>Interviewees will be asked various questions related to their experience as a caregiver and their emotional state during the experience. This interview would be conducted via a recorded <a href="https://uci.zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UCI Zoom</a> call (or a recorded in-person interview if the individual is in Irvine, CA). The information interviewees provide will be kept confidential, and if we do choose to publish our results, their identity will be anonymized. The data collected will be fully confidential otherwise and will be deleted upon our research's completion.</p>

        <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A individual who has been a caretaker for a family member in hospice</li>
            <li>A healthcare professional who</li>
            <ul>
                <li>has experience working with hospice patients</li>
                <li>has experience with emotional well-being</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
        <p>If you choose to participate in our research interview, you will be compensated with a $20 Starbucks gift card. Your contribution will help us understand hospice management to create a better experience for everyone involved.</p>
