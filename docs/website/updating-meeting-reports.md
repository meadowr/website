# Updating Meeting Reports

![Docusaurus header from GitHub](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/51929caaeeaf41308befe091f8cfae176fcb462a7251d3cc3e8ea11d0693a011/68747470733a2f2f646f63757361757275732e696f2f696d672f736c6173682d696e74726f647563696e672e737667)

The Ojos Project keeps [meeting reports](/docs/meeting-reports) so that we
have a record of attendance and the things we've been doing in the lab. Carlos
tries to keep this updated, but he won't always know everything that is going
on. Therefore, this document is here to show how to maintain it.

## Use the `meeting-reports` branch

If you want to update the meeting reports, you have to
[use the `meeting-reports` branch](https://github.com/ojosproject/website/tree/meeting-reports).

[Use this quick link to access `meeting-reports.md` on the `meeting-reports` branch](https://github.dev/ojosproject/website/blob/meeting-reports/docs/url/meeting-reports.md).
