# Kimai: Time Logging and Attendance

In order to better keep track of attendance and time logging for Summer 2024,
Ojos Project is going to be using [Kimai](https://github.com/kimai/kimai/).
Kimai is a free and open-source time logger. We will be using this software to
log our hours at the project.

## Logging In

To log into Kimai, you must go to
[timesheet.ojosproject.org](timesheet.ojosproject.org). **Your login username
will be your UCINetID.** That is, the part before `@uci.edu` in your emails. The
program will prompt you to change your password.
