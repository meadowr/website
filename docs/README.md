# Ojos Project Docs

![Ojos Project header](@site/static/images/header.png)

The Ojos Project Docs' goal is to provide you with as much information of the
project as possible in a simple and easy to understand way. Although the project
is relatively young, our documentation is rapidly growing on a near-daily basis.

## Getting Started

There's a lot of different things you can get out of these documents. As of now,
we're still working on software design and engineering design. You may just have
to refer to the [URL Group's Developers Docs](/url/developers) or the
[URL Group's Engineering Docs](/url/engineering/). Both are great starting
points!

## Need help?

These docs should be simple to understand and constantly updated. If that is not
the case, please contact either [Joseph Sweatt](mailto:jsweatt@uci.edu) for the
Engineering Docs or [Carlos Valdez](mailto:cvaldezh@uci.edu) for everything else
in the docs.

Otherwise, you may raise an issue in our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ojosproject/website/issues/new?assignees=calejvaldez&labels=documentation&template=docs.yml&title=âš %EF%B8%8F+Insert+a+short+title+for+your+issue.).

Thanks!
