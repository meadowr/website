# URL Group

The [Undergraduate Research Lab](https://markbaldw.in/url/) is a research lab by
[Dr. Mark S. Baldwin](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/explore/faculty-profiles/mark-baldwin/)
at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu).

The goal of the URL Group at the Ojos Project is to develop a hospice device
that will make hospice patients more independent while helping caregivers care
for their loved one.
