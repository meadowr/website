# C4 Model

## Getting Started

A [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) is a useful way to outline the software
architecture of a system. We're going to be using this model to get a clearer
idea of how Iris is going to interact with Linux and other hardware devices that
may be installed.

We use [Figma](https://figma.com/) for our C4 Model.
