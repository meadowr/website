# Email Policies

To participate in the Ojos Project, we must have an email associated with you.

## Approved Domains

Your email must come from one of the approved domains:

| Domain                   | Association                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@uci.edu`               | [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu)                                |
| `@ics.uci.edu`           | [UCI Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences](https://ics.uci.edu) |
| `@students.imperial.edu` | [Imperial Valley College](https://imperial.edu/)                                   |

:::note

Don't see you domain? Let Carlos know. It just means we haven't had people
with that domain before. Remember, it has to be from an educational
or professional institution. Often, that means it must end with `.edu`.
