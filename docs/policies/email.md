# Email Policies

To participate in the Ojos Project, we must have an email associated with you.
Your email must come from any of the approved email domains:

| Domain                   | Association                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@uci.edu`               | [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu)                                |
| `@ics.uci.edu`           | [UCI Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences](https://ics.uci.edu) |
| `@students.imperial.edu` | [Imperial Valley College](https://imperial.edu/)                                   |

:::note

Don't see you domain? Let Carlos know. It just means we haven't had students
with that domain before. Remember, it has to be from an educational institution.
That is, it must end with `.edu`.

calendar invites, Gravatar, and other invites that require email addresses.
