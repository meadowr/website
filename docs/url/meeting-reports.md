### Developers

The Developers worked on the C4 Model more, creating a rough draft of the
Container Diagram and the Component Diagram, both of which will be found in the
[C4 Model page](/docs/url/developers/c4-model).

The Developers have also agreed to develop a mobile app for Iris written in
[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) to keep only one extra codebase. This
app would be available for iOS, Android, and the Web. It is currently codenamed
"Iris Lite" and is meant to be a read-only version of the Iris data.

The Developers have agreed to meet on Fridays from 12 PM - 4 PM to ensure we
have prototype software for the Symposium.

We have a checklist we have to get done before the Symposium:

- [ ] Finish C4 Model
- [ ] Figma prototypes
- [ ] Learn... (we may decide to choose a different language)
  - [ ] Rust
  - [ ] GNOME ecosystem

### Engineering

The Engineering team continued with computer aided designs and finished their
first iteration of the designs.
