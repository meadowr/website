# Symposium Protocols

The 2024 Symposium is at the end of the week! This document will provide a look
into what to expect for the symposium, things to bring, and how the prototype
will be used during the symposium.

:::warning

Please read this document in its entirety. It provides important information,
and covers things we may not be able to cover together during the lab.

:::

## What to bring

Source: [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/750672dc-2eaf-461e-a929-c9e5a63c829b)

### The poster

This is a no-brainer, but important to mention.

### Your resume

If you care about networking, it might be beneficial to bring your resume to the
symposium. All of our resumes will be displayed on the table for people to grab.

Remember, *anybody* could go to the symposium. Local business people, other
researchers, etc.

If you need help building a resume, [refer to this guide by the UCI Division of
Career Pathways](https://career.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/QT_ResumeHelp.pdf).
We likely will not have time to cover this during lab.

### Developers: your computer

Developers should bring their computers just in case. Read [below for more
information](#developers-be-ready-for-anything-bugs-mostly).

### Chargers

We'll be here for a while, so bringing your charger or a power bank is a good
idea!

### Water bottle/snacks

**Note: Carlos will not bring this!**

Please bring water bottles and/or snacks if you feel like you'll need some.

### Professional/comfortable attire

Since we're going to be here for a while, bring comfortable attire! Carlos
doesn't really care if it's professional or not; however, please don't bring
something like shorts or a tank top.

## Developers! Be ready for anything (bugs, mostly)

We know Iris is in a very not-so-ready state. If we manage to get a prototype
ready by the time the symposium comes around, it will be in a **heavily unstable
beta**. Please be ready to step in if we have to do any quick fixes for critical
bugs.

:::warning

Developers have sole discretion as to the state of the machine. That is,
turning the system on/off, how people interact with the prototype, etc. **If
anything goes wrong, and we know for a fact it's a software issue, developers
should step in!**

## Iris

It's likely that we don't have time during lab that we go over what Iris is.
This is here to help you prepare for the symposium. **IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,
TELL CARLOS IMMEDIATELY**. I might have overlooked something.

### Comprehensive overview for Iris

<!-- ! Mention its features, the background, the reasons for the decisions made, etc. -->

> Iris is a free and open-source hospice system for at-home care written in
> Python. It is primarily written with Linux in mind, so it can be installed in
> almost any Linux system available, if they adhere for the following
> requirements:
>
> 1. The system has a display
> 2. The system has some way to provide input (mouse/touchscreen)
> 3. The system has a `dnf` or `apt` package manager
>
> Since it is free and open-source, anyone can contribute to the project, making
> this a large collaborative effort not just with UCI, but with anybody in
> education or industry who may want to improve this system.
>
> We want to make this as accessible as possible. Iris itself will be free, and
> we will provide instructions for people to set it up on their own devices if
> they have an old computer they're not using and would like to once again give it
> life. This provides a few benefits:
>
> 1. Low-income individuals don't have to buy another computer, they can just
> use an old computer if they have one
> 2. It reduces computer waste, as Iris (and Linux!) can provide an extended
> purpose

### Simple overview for Iris

Use this if people aren't too tech savvy.

> Iris is a computer program for family taking care of someone in hospice.

### Why we made the decisions we made

## Palliaview

Again, it's likely that we don't have time during lab that we go over what Palliaview
is. This is here to help you prepare for the symposium. **IF YOU HAVE ANY
QUESTIONS, TELL CARLOS IMMEDIATELY**. I might have overlooked something.

### Comprehensive overview for Palliaview

> Palliaview is a Raspberry Pi-based computer we designed to provide a seamless
> Iris experience. There's little to no setup, and as soon as it turns on, it is
> ready to use.
>
> Palliaview is designed with hospice-care in mind, using materials that is best
> suited for a healthcare environment.
>
> The benefits Palliaview provides are:
>
> 1. No Iris setup or computer knowledge needed, just plug and play
> 2. Palliaview uses high quality materials and a touch screen display, making
> it more effective to use than installing Iris on an old laptop
> 3. It uses the same free and open-source software, except your experience is
> enhanced thanks to a tighter integration between hardware and software.
