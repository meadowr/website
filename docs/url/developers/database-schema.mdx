# Database Schema

## Getting Started

A database schema helps us visualize how the structure of Iris' database
will look like. This is helpful for us as developers to look back at and keep it
updated to use it as a resource.

We use [Figma](https://figma.com/) for our database schema design. [Here's a
helpful resource to learn about database schemas](https://planetscale.com/blog/schema-design-101-relational-databases).
