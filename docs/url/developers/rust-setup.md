# Getting Started with Rust

Rust is a powerful programming language and the one we're going to be using in
the Ojos Project. This document is here to help you get setup.

## Install `rustup`

First, go to [the Rust Language website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
and install `rustup`. If you use Windows, install the `.exe`. If you use macOS
or Linux, use the install script.

This will install `rustc`, `cargo`, and `rustup`.

| Tool     | Description                                                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rustc`  | The Rust compiler                                          |
| `cargo`  | A tool similar to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)            |
| `rustup` | Manages these tools, such as updating with `rustup update` |

## Installing the `rust-analyzer` extension

The majority of people in the Ojos Project uses Visual Studio Code for coding.
`rust-analyzer` is the official extension from the Rust Programming Language.
Please install it from the [Extensions Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).

:::tip

If you don't use Visual Studio Code,
[there's more resources available for you](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools).

## Resources

Rust has a **lot** of resources available. Here's some of the ones we're going
to be using:

- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust Learning Material](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)
- [Tour of Rust](https://tourofrust.com/)
- [Rust Exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
- [Advanced Rust YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa)

... and there's likely more. If you know any more, please edit this page!
