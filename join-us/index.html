        <h1>ü§ù Join the Ojos Project</h1>
        <h2 id="introduction">üëã Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Ojos Project is looking for people interested in research to join! We are a research project under UC Irvine professor Mark S. Baldwin's <a href="https://markbaldw.in/url/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Undergraduate Research Lab</a>.</p>
        <p>Whether you're experienced with Linux or are a fantastic writer, we'd love to have you! Take a look <a href="#help-wanted">below</a> for how you can help!</p>

        <h2 id="purpose">‚ù§Ô∏è Purpose</h2>
        <p>Hospice patients are often immobile and slowly lose their independence, relying on the people around them to take care of them. It's difficult to help someone in this position when we often have other responsibilities, such as work.</p>
        <p>During this moment, caregivers often have a lot on their mind. This can become dangerous if the caregiver forgets critical information about the patient's care, loses track of how often medication was taken, or forgets to report the patient's level of comfort.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the Ojos Project is to increase patient independence by providing a kiosk-like assistant and to make sure all caregivers are on the same page by ensuring all information on the kiosk is up to date and synchronized with their personal devices.</p>

        <h2 id="activities">üõ†Ô∏è What are we doing?</h2>
        <p>We're researching the needs of hospice patients and caregivers to provide them with an easier way for caregivers to manage their loved one's care, while also allowing the patient as much independence as they would like.</p>
        <p>Our current plan is to use tools such as the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raspberry Pi OS</a> to build this system while experimenting with Linux Window Managers such as the <a href="https://awesomewm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awesome window manager</a>. This may also include programming languages such as <a href="https://www.lua.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lua</a> and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust</a>.</p>
        <p>All of our software will be for the good of those in need, and will be 100% free and open-source.</p>

        <h2 id="responsibilities">üë∑ Member Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Considering we're being graded for this project, there will be responsibilities for this project. At the very minimum, the responsibilities include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A minimum of a two-quarter commitment</li>
            <li>Meeting at least twice a week (once with Prof. Baldwin, another to work)</li>
            <li>Meeting responsibilities as outlined in our internal timeline</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="help-wanted">üôã How you can help!</h2>
        <p>We're looking for individuals who already know, or are curious about, various technologies such as Linux, programming languages, or modifying existing software.</p>
        <p>You can help if you want to do any of the following things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Work with a Raspberry Pi</li>
          <li>Work with Linux/Raspberry Pi OS</li>
          <li>Work with programming languages (Soon!)</li>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_documentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Documenting our work</a>/general paperwork</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is a learning experience for everyone, so if you don't know how to do some of the things in this least, please know we may just be in a similar boat! üõ∂</p>

        <p>The benefits of joining the project include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Course credit for UCI students</li>
            <li>Experience with...</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Research</li>
              <li>Raspberry Pi</li>
              <li>Linux</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="contact">üìß Contact</h2>
