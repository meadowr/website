        <h1 id="Introduction">Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Ojos Project is looking for individuals to join! We are a research project under UC Irvine professor Mark S. Baldwin's <a href="https://markbaldw.in/url/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Undergraduate Research Lab</a>.</p>

        <p>The benefits of joining the project include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A course grade (IN4MATX 199)</li>
            <li>Research experience</li>
            <li>Linux/Raspberry Pi experience (and potentially Lua and Rust)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="activities">What are we doing?</h2>
        <p>We're researching the needs of hospice patients and caregivers to provide them with an easier way for caregivers to manage their loved one's care. Our plan is to create a device that will help synchronize important details of their loved one's care, such as medications and other care instructions.</p>
        <p>Our current plan is to use tools such as the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raspberry Pi OS</a> to build this system while experimenting with Linux Window Managers such as the <a href="https://awesomewm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awesome window manager</a>. This may also include programming languages such as <a href="https://www.lua.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lua</a> and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust</a>.</p>
        <p>All of our software will be for the good of those in need, and will be 100% free and open-source.</p>

        <h2 id="responsibilities">Member Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Considering we're being graded for this project, there will be responsibilities for this project. At the very minimum, the responsibilities include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A minimum of a two-quarter commitment</li>
            <li>Meeting at least twice a week (once with Prof. Baldwin, another to work)</li>
            <li>Meeting responsibilities as outlined in our internal timeline</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="requirements">What are we looking for?</h2>
        <p>We're looking for individuals who already know, or are curious about, various technologies such as Linux, programming languages, or modifying existing software. Our end goal is to create a device that synchronizes hospice patient health to make life easier for caregivers.</p>
        <p>If you want to work with a Raspberry Pi, Linux, programming languages, or even just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_documentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing documentation for our work</a>, we're looking for you!</p>

        <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
        <p>If you'd like to join, or have any questions, please contact Carlos Valdez via <a href="mailto:cvaldezh@uci.edu">cvaldezh@uci.edu</a> and he'll get back to you as soon as possible!</p>
