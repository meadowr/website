Welcome to the repository for the Ojos Project's website.

## Transition to Vite

As of the writing of this document, the current website is written in HTML and
CSS. This worked fine at first, [until we had to make a news post and realized
we needed to have a `news` subsection route](https://ojos.calejvaldez.com/news/1706645600/). So, we're transitioning to using the following techologies:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

We're doing this so that it can become (somewhat) easier to manage the website.
Since the website is small, I don't think it'll be too big of an effort.
