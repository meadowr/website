## What's in a domain? (and why a `.org`?)

For the general public, a domain is a website such as `wikipedia.org`. At the same time, a domain is an identity. It helps identify valid email addresses and subdomains. I've been wanting to get a domain for the Ojos Project for the sole purpose of identity.

The reason we're a `.org` is because I want to follow the path of other open-source projects, such as [GNOME](https://gnome.org/) and [KDE](https://kde.org/), both with `.org` domains. A `.com` is often associated with "commercial", while a `.org` is associated with "organization".

My goal for the Ojos Project, whether it stays as undergraduate research or goes beyond that, is to ensure we provide free and open-source software in the healthcare space, similar to [GNU Health](https://www.gnuhealth.org/). We are not a commercial project.

## Subdomains

At some point, subdomains will be added to `ojosproject.org`. It's faster to type something like `docs.ojosproject.org` instead of `docs.ojos.calejvaldez.com`. It is a big part of why I made the change.

The Ojos Project is slowly but surely becoming something more complicated than a single-page website. We're moving, writing documentation, etc. I want us to be ready for that ahead of time.

## What about `ojos.calejvaldez.com`?

The deprecated subdomain will still be available and updated for a few more days, or even weeks. Eventually, I will redirect the subdomain to the new `ojosproject.org` domain. It's heavily recommended to use the new domain.

Edit: `ojos.calejvaldez.com` will now redirect to `ojosproject.org` and will no longer be updated. Everything before **February 22, 2024** will be redirected.

## Can I see the code?

Of course. It's available on [our GitLab page](https://gitlab.com/ojosproject/website).
