# Winter 2024 Wrap Up

## A look back

### Interviews

As [we've announced earlier in the quarter](https://ojosproject.org/news/1706645600/),
the Ojos Project conducted various interviews with families and healthcare
providers. We've interviewed **four caregivers** and **two healthcare
professionals**. These interviews gave us valuable information that will be
used for the project.

### Requirements

The Ojos Project has also started [requirement analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis).
Requirements analysis is a vital part to software engineering and it ensures we
are building the right thing with the information we've gotten from the
interviews and our research.

Since our requirements aren't yet ready, it isn't published. Once it is though,
[you can find them here](https://docs.ojosproject.org/teams/url/requirements/).

### (More) Research

We're researching various academic papers regarding hospice, and even started
a [Research Team](https://docs.ojosproject.org/teams/research/) to help with
reading these articles. Since we weren't able to interview hospice nurses who
were on-site in taking care of a patient, we are looking into the various
things hospice nurses have stated in previous academic journals to get a better
idea of how our device may be able to help them.

[You can view our research notes here](https://docs.ojosproject.org/teams/research/).

### Other Accomplishments

We managed to build two websites to help us communicate our ideas.
[ojosproject.org](https://ojosproject.org/) and
[docs.ojosproject.org](https://docs.ojosproject.org/) for general announcements
and documentation, respectively.

## A look forward

The plans for Spring quarter are a bit fuzzy, but this is what I am (currently)
considering:

- Teams
  - Splitting the [URL team](https://docs.ojosproject.org/teams/url/) into more
    focused teams, such as developers and engineering
  - Getting someone to properly lead the Research Team
  - Getting someone to lead individuals at IVC
- Requirements
  - Finalizing an iteration of the requirements
  - Start software development
  - More interviews conducted by other team members
  - Continuing to research academic papers
- [Undergraduate Research Lab](https://markbaldw.in/url/) (URL Team)
  - We plan to sign up for the
    [UROP Summer Undergraduate Research Program](https://urop.uci.edu/urop-opportunities/#surp)

## Acknowledgements

First and foremost, thank you to our interviewees who participated in our
project. Your input helped us understand the different ways we can help patients
and caregivers alike.

And of course, from the bottom of my heart to
[the entire team](https://ojosproject.org/#team). Without you, none of this
would have been possible.

Have a fantastic spring break! üëãüèΩ
